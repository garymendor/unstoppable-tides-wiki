# Bathroom Control Institute
The Bathroom Control Institute (or Behavior Control Institute, as it is officially known) is a private juvenile "rehabilitation" facility for girls, focused on inflicting bathroom-related humiliation on its inmates: limiting their use the restroom to the point that they are regularly forced to urinate and defecate in their panties, and requiring them to perform even more humiliating acts to be allowed to change out of their filthy underwear.

The BCI functions as a boarding school where the inmates are kept out of contact with the outside world, ensuring that there is no one to save them from the constant humilations and degredations.

## Inmates
The inmates are young women of junior high and high school age, sentenced to a term in BCI by judges who select defendants with the right mental vulnerabilities to suffer from the humiliations of BCI life. It is not unheard of for BCI inmates to be innocent of the crimes of which they are accused, if they or their families lack the resources to defend them from these courts.
## Staff
The school is staffed by well-connected individuals who delight in humiliating young ladies in this fashion, though they are also qualified for their actual jobs. 
## Students
In addition to the inmates, the student body is filled out with the children of donors to the BCI project, who in addition to receiving a top-notch education, also get to enjoy abusing their inmate "classmates". Students are screened for their emotional predilections; they are sadistic and actively enjoy watching girls be forced to wet and soil themselves, or at least have no problem with their victims wearing pee-soaked and poop-filled panties.

* **Potidiol**: A drug that causes the inmate to need to urinate and defecate frequently.
* **Urgencinin**: A drug that causes the inmate to experience weakened or nonexistent control over her bodily functions.
