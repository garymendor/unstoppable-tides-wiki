# Detention
Mild or moderate misbehavior may be punished with detention.

Inmates assigned to detention must report to the detention hall immediately after school, and may not go to the restroom between the end of class and the start of detention. Upon arriving at detention, the inmate must drink 500mL of sports drink, and a half-hour dose of Urgencinin-W, ensuring that she will not be able to hold her pee for more than a half hour. Moderate offenses may also include a half-hour dose of Urgencinin-S, ensuring that the she will also be unable to hold her poo for more than a half hour.

Students may also be assigned detention, but are allowed to go to the bathroom first and will not be required to take Urgencinin. Their detention does not take place in the same detention hall as inmates.

The detention hall resembles a typical classroom, but is surrounded by a viewing gallery, allowing students and teachers to watch the inmates during detention. Each inmate is assigned a student minder, who is admitted to the detention hall to serve as a personal witness for the inmate's punishment.

Inmates are required to ask to go to the bathroom as soon as they feel the urge; the detention monitor will ask her student minder to dictate the manner in which the inmate must have her accident. If the detention monitor suspects that an inmate is hiding her need to go, she will be immediately ordered have an accident and have a half hour added to their detention. Possible accident scenarios:
* The inmate must wet or soil herself at her desk. As with normal classrooms, inmate chairs have a deep seat with no drainage, ensuring that an inmate who wets herself while seated will leave a sizeable puddle. Afterward, she must "admit" that she didn't know she needed to go to the bathroom, and will be berated for not paying more attention to her urges.
* The inmate must go to the blackboard to wet or soil herself; if she is wetting herself, her feet must be together so that the urine runs down her legs. Afterward, she must "admit" that she couldn't hold it any longer, and will be berated for not being toilet trained.
* The inmate must go to the blackboard, hold her clothing against her crotch (if she needs to pee) or bottom (if she needs to poo), and remain there until she cannot hold it any longer. She must continue to beg to be allowed to go to the bathroom the whole time. Afterward, she must "admit" that she could have held it longer but didn't bother, and will be berated for not trying hard enough to make it to the bathroom.

Once the inmate has had an accident, she must lift her skirt or lower her pants and present her freshly wet or soiled panties to her student minder; the minder may "inspect" the inmate's panties by rubbing her pee-soaked crotch or pressing her load of poop against her bottom. The inspection may continue for
up to thirty seconds before the student minder announces loudly "*Inmate Name* just wet/soiled herself." The detention monitor will then berate the student in the appropriate manner. The inmate must remain with her panties presented until her student minder has finished their "inspection"; the inmate must then get the mop and bucket and clean any mess she made on the floor before returning to her seat. (If she had a seated wetting, she may *not* empty her chair, but must sit in the puddle.)

Inmates may not have their panties changed during detention; they must *ask* their student minder to change them when the panty "inspection" is done, but the minder will tell her that she must wait until detention is over. At the end of detention, all the inmates must stand, present their panties to their student minder again, and ask the minder to change them. Each minder may take up to a minute to "inspect" the inmate's panties again, then demand whatever they want of the inmate or refuse to change them. A supply of clean panties and pull-ups in appropriate sizes will be present; the minder will choose what panties to change the inmate into.
