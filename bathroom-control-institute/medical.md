# Medical Enhancements
The BCI is powered by several medical enhancements developed by talented (and, of course, perverse) doctors.

## Potidiol
Potidiol is a time-release mixture of medications designed to be safe for the kidneys and intestines despite regular use. It is designed to be taken once every eight hours, with an additional Potidiol PM formulation for nighttime use.

A dose of Potidiol includes:
* A diuretic that will cause the recipient's kidneys to generate between four and five bladderfuls of urine.
* A fiber laxative that ensures the recipient will likely need to defecate at least once.
* A medication that induces mildly increased thirst, ensuring that the increased urine or feces production does not cause dehydration.
* Additional ingredients that promote kidney and intestinal health.

Inmates on two daily doses of Potidiol will thus need to pee between eight to ten times a day and poop an average of twice a day.

Potidiol PM includes:
* A vasopressin antagonist. Vasopression (anti-diuretic hormone) normally causes the body to produce less urine while asleep; the vasopressin antagonist reduces the effectiveness, causing the recipient to produce between two and three bladderfuls of urine over the course of eight hours.
* A targeted anesthetic that greatly reduces the sensation of fullness in the bladder.

Inmates on Potidiol PM will need to pee at least once or twice in the night, and will not be awakened by a full bladder, virtually guaranteeing that the inmate will wet the bed.

## Urgencinin
Urgencinin is a medication consisting of a tailored muscle relaxant that is designed to weaken the strength of the urinary sphincter (Urgencinin-W) or anal sphincter (Urgencinin-S). An inmate under the effects of Urgencinin-W will experience a sudden increased need to urinate, and will have difficulty controlling her bladder; Urgencinin-S will cause an increased need to defecate and difficulty controlling her bowels. To prevent a dose from causing long-term problems, it is designed to dissipate shortly after the affected muscle has been completely relaxed for a significant period - that is, when the inmate urinates or defecates.

An inmate's dose of Potidiol will often contain granules of Urgencinin that will be released at irregular intervals and in varying dosages. The result is that the inmate will experience unpredictable "episodes" of sudden bathroom urgency or incontinence. The number and concentration of Urgencinin granules varies according to the inmate's sentence; mild sentences may have very few granules of low strength, whereas a severe offender's Potidiol dose may contain five high-strength granules of Urgencinin-W and a high-strength granule of Urgencinin-S.

Urgencinin can also be given directly to inmates as a punishment. These doses are calibrated, allowing the teacher or staff member to choose how long the student will be able to hold it after feeling the first urge.

## DiaperLotion (name TBD)
With every change of panties or diaper, the "diaper area" of inmates is coated with DiaperLotion. This lotion is designed to greatly reduce the skin irritation due to prolonged contact with urine or feces, or the chafing of wet fabric. Inmates that have been given DiaperLotion will not experience diaper rash even if they spend hours wearing wet or soiled underwear.

DiaperLotion may be enhanced with an additional chemical which turns into a contact aphrodisiac when mixed with substances in urine or feces. If the inmate's lotion has been thus enhanced, she will experience sexual arousal when the treated skin is doused with urine or smeared with feces. This is used to condition the inmate to associate sexual desire with wetting or soiling herself.
