<!-- TITLE: Inmate Life -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Inmate Life -->

The inmates of BCI are young women of junior high and high school age, sentenced to a term in BCI by judges who select defendants with the right mental vulnerabilities to suffer from the humiliations of BCI life. It is not unheard of for BCI inmates to be innocent of the crimes of which they are accused, if they or their families lack the resources to defend them from these courts.

An inmate at BCI can expect to be repeatedly forced to wet or soil herself, go for prolonged periods without being allowed to change her dirty panties, and be forced to perform humiliating chores to get those changes. The degradation is as much psychological as physical - inmates are taunted and mocked for their shameful accidents, treated as if they were willful little girls who aren't properly toilet trained and not trying very hard to be, and told that they don't deserve to have clean panties.

Every morning, at the start of the day, every inmate has to recite the BCI Motto:
> Good girls can make it to the toilet when they need to pee.
> Bad girls can't or won't hold their pee - instead, they have a wetting accident and pee in their panties.
> Good girls can make it to the toilet when they need to poo.
> Bad girls can't or won't hold their poo - instead, they have a soiling accident and poo in their panties.
> Good girls deserve nice clean panties to wear.
> Bad girls only deserve to wear panties they have peed and pooped in.
> I am a bad girl.
> The only potty I deserve is my panties.
> And the only panties I deserve are panties I've gone potty in.
# Bathroom Control
The most important rule at BCI is that inmates are *not allowed* to urinate or defecate unless specifically authorized by a teacher or staff member, and are *required* to urinate or defecate as directed by a teacher or staff member.

An inmate that needs to go to the bathroom must immediately inform the nearest authority, indicating whether she needs to pee or poop. The authority will then decide whether or not the inmate is allowed to relieve herself, and in what manner she must do so. If the inmate is denied permission to go to the bathroom, she is allowed to continue to beg until told to stop. However, if the inmate is ordered to "have an accident", she must immediately do so without any further comment or face additional punishment.

If an inmate is denied permission to go to the bathroom, she may instead ask for permission to have an accident. This request also may be granted or denied at the authority's discretion. Once an inmate has asked permission to wet or soil herself, she will no longer be allowed to use the toilet in any circumstances; she must either wet or soil herself if given permission, or hold it if she is not.

When an inmate receives permission to go to the bathroom, she must also ask the restroom monitor for permission to go to the bathroom. The restroom monitor may either allow the inmate to go, forbid her from using that bathroom (requiring the student to find another bathroom), or order her to have an accident (either outside the restroom or in front of the toilet). If the restroom monitor orders the inmate to have an accident, the inmate must return to the authority that originally gave her bathroom permission and tell them that she didn't make it.

## Accident On Command
An inmate ordered to "have an accident" must proceed to the location specified by the authority (typically a public place - during class, this is usually in front of the blackboard), adopt whatever pose is ordered of them, and proceed to urinate or defecate in her panties or diaper until she is empty.

In the social context of BCI, this is treated as if the inmate had actually had an accident. Students will laugh and point, commenting on how shameful it is that the inmate could not make it to the bathroom, how she would've made it if she were a big girl, and so forth. Inmates are *required* to join in this mockery; any inmate that fails to express at least some scorn for another inmate having an accident will generally receive a mild punishment.

Once the inmate has done wetting or soiling herself, the authority will generally berate the inmate for her poor toilet training, accuse her of not trying hard enough to make it to the bathroom, and so forth. The authority may also order the inmate to:
* **Tell everyone what you just did**: The inmate must answer along the lines of "I wet myself" or "I pooped my panties."
* **Show everyone what you just did**: The inmate must lower her pants or lift her skirt and present her freshly wet or soiled panties.
* **Tell us why you had an accident**: The inmate must answer along the lines of "I couldn't hold it any longer," "I had to go too bad", or otherwise falsely claim that she involuntarily wet or soiled herself. If the inmate truthfully answers that she was told to have an accident, she will be called a liar, interrogated until she "admits the truth", and given additional punishment.

## "Actual" Accidents
At times, an inmate may actually lose control of her bladder or bowels, either because of a dose of Urgencinin or because she was simply denied permission to go until she genuinely could not hold it any longer.

When an inmate feels herself begin to lose control of her bodily functions, she must immediately go to the nearest authority, announce "I'm peeing/pooping6 my panties", and remain in place until she has finished wetting or soiling herself. If she loses control in class, she must stand up beside her seat and make the announcement. If she has finished going before she reaches an authority, she must make her announcement in the past tense.

When interrogated as to why the inmate had an accident, the inmate must answer along the lines of "I didn't want to wait to go to the bathroom like a big girl", "I decided I'd rather go to the bathroom in my panties", or otherwise falsely assert that she voluntarily wet or soiled herself. As with the reverse case, if the inmate truthfully answers that she couldn't hold it, she will be called a liar, accused of deliberately wetting or soiling herself until she "admits the truth", and given additional punishment.

Regardless of the reason, any inmate who has an "actual" accident will be punished for going in her panties on purpose. Inmates are encouraged to ask for permission to have an accident to avoid this punishment.

## Bedwetting
Thanks to Potidiol PM, it is virtually guaranteed that all inmates will wet the bed every night. Accordingly, the student is normally allowed to wear pull-ups. If an inmate wets enough for her pajamas and sheets to be soaked, she will be berated by the dorm manager, being told that she should get up to go to the bathroom when she needs to pee instead of peeing in her pajamas. This is deliberately unfair, as inmates are not allowed to get out of bed in the night.

If the inmate does not already urgently need to urinate, the dorm manager will administer a dose of Urgencinin-W to ensure that she does. The inmate will then be required to carry her wet sheets to the clothesline in front of the dormitories, hang them on the line, then remove her pajamas and hang those on the line as well, then stand beside her wet sheets and pajamas wearing only her wet underwear for fifteen minutes. 

During her bedwetting punishment, the inmate is required to stand with her hands behind her back and her feet 30cm apart, and is not allowed to hold her hands in front of her in any way, nor allow her knees to touch; each attempt to hold herself or put her legs together will add one minute to her sentence. The inmate is encouraged to beg to be allowed to go to the bathroom, but will be told to hold it until her bedwetting punishment is over. She will eventually wet herself, which will be treated as usual for an "actual" accident.
# Underwear
## Panties
Standard BCI-issue inmate panties are high-tech garments that have the following features:
* The panties are made of a thick cotton-like material that absorbs a considerable volume of urine (though not a full wetting) and becomes translucent when wet. They are often decorated with childish patterns that change color when wet.
* The gusset of the panties includes an extra layer of absorptive fabric against the skin, with a waterproof layer between. This will cause urine to pool in the crotch of the panties.
* The outer layer of the panties is coated in a partially waterproof layer; wet panties will still be damp to the touch, but will dry very slowly.
* The seat of the panties is elastic, capable of accommodating a full soiling while holding the feces firmly against the inmate's bottom.
* The leg and waist elastics are strong enough to keep soiled panties from falling off.
* There is a drawstring in the waist which can be tied to keep the panties from falling off after multiple soilings.
* The leg elastics are waterproof but contain leak holes where the leg meets the torso. This will cause urine to tend to run down the inmate's legs instead of pouring from the lowest part of the crotch.

## Pull-ups
Pull-ups are generally used as a punishment, or for nighttime use. They have the following features:
* The pull-ups are obviously bulky and contain enough padding to absorb about two bladderfuls.
* An inner thin fabric feel-wet layer causes the pull-ups to feel damp on the slightest leak.
* The outer layer is completely waterproof and designed to crinkle.
* The leg elastics are leak-resistant, but are designed to leak first at the crotch, like normal panties.

## Diapers
Full diapers are used almost entirely as a punishment. They are similar to pull-ups except they are thicker and more absorbent (enough to absorb five or six wettings), and are taped up. Inmates may not ask to go to the bathroom or to have an accident while wearing diapers; instead, they must announce that they have wet or soiled themselves *after* doing so. They will not be punished for having an "actual" accident, merely berated as if they were an infant who wasn't ready for big-girl panties.
# Cleanup
An inmate who has wet or soiled her panties is required to continue to wear her soaked or loaded panties until given permission by an authority to change. Except in rare instances, an inmate will not be granted permission to change her own panties, and she will be severely punished if she attempts to do so without permission.

## Asking permission
A wet or soiled inmate must ask an authority for permission to get a change, saying whether she is wet or soiled or both. The authority can agree to change the inmate, refuse to allow her to change, require her to wait, or require the inmate to perform any task in order to get permission to change. It is customary for inmates to be required to sexually gratify someone, either the authority themselves or another authority or student, to get permission. The authority may also allow another authority or a student to change the inmate, or have the other person supply their own requirements to grant the change of panties.

The inmate is allowed to refuse to perform a task required of her, but obviously must then continue to wear her dirty panties, and cannot subsequently ask the same authority for permission to change unless she has gone to the bathroom (either in the toilet or in her panties again) since she first asked.

Whenever the inmate goes to the bathroom in her panties, she must immediately ask the nearest authority for permission to change. It is customary for the authority to deny this request outright (usually with a lecture on why the inmate doesn't deserve clean panties) and forbid the student from asking again.

# Punishments
Inmates who disobey the rules are subjected to a variety of punishments. Most punishments are imposed for explicit disobedience in some fashion. However, many inmates include having punishments imposed upon them at regular intervals without a specific in-school disobedient act; these are considered to be part of their punishment for the crime they originally committed.

## Mild punishments
Mild punishments are imposed for minor infractions, including but not limited to:
* Wetting or soiling herself without permission, or *failing* to wet or soil herself when ordered.
* Masturbating without permission, or *failing* to masturbate when ordered.
* Talking back to a teacher.

Examples of mild punishments:
* **Bedwetter:** The inmate must wear panties to bed the next night (with Potidiol PM, this guarantees that she will wet the bed).
* **Flasher:** The inmate must expose her panties or bra on demand for up to an hour. An authority may require her to remain exposed for the duration.
* **Desperate to Pee:** The inmate must take a dose of Urgencinin-W; if she needs to pee in the next hour, she must wet herself.
* **Wetting Detention:** The inmate must attend [detention,](/bathroom-control-institute/school#detention) and take a dose of Urgencinin-W before detention begins.
* **Panty Wetter:** The inmate must wet herself the next two times she pees. She may change between wettings.
* **Panty Pooper:** The inmate must soil herself the next time she poops.
* **Staying Wet:** The inmate may not have her panties changed unless she has wet them at least twice.
* **Wet Pull-ups:** The inmate must be changed into pull-ups; she will be allowed to ask to go to the bathroom as normal, but she will not be allowed a change until the pull-ups have leaked urine.

## Moderate punishments
Moderate punishments are imposed for infractions such as:
* Attempting (unsuccessfully) to use the bathroom without permission.
* Wetting or soiling herself in secret.
* Changing her own panties.
* Attempting to evade a mild punishment.

Examples of moderate punishments:
* Two mild punishments at once.
* If the inmate attempted to evade a mild punishment involving denial of bathroom or changing privileges, she must wear a restraint (locked punishment shorts, wrist shackles, bondage mittens) until she has performed the mild punishment.
* **Full Day Flasher:** For the next twenty-four hours, the inmate must remove her shirt for any authority or student who asks to see her bra, and lift her skirt or pull down her pants for anyone who asks to see her panties. She is not required to allow them to touch her body.
* **Desperate to Poo:** The inmate must take a dose of Urgencinin-W and Urgencinin-S; if she needs to pee or poop in the next hour, she must wet or soil herself.
* **Soiling Detention:** The inmate must attend [detention,](/bathroom-control-institute/school#detention)  and take a dose of Urgencinin-W and Urgencinin-S before detention begins.
* **Wet Wetter:** The inmate must wet herself the next two times she pees. She may not change until after the second wetting.
* **Heavy Wetter:** The inmate must wet herself the next three times she pees. She may change between wettings.
* **Double Trouble:** The inmate must wet herself the next time she pees, and soil herself the next time she poops. She may not change until she has done both, but may use the bathroom to pee once she has wet herself.
* **Soggy and Squishy:** The inmate may not ask permission to change her panties unless she has wet herself while already soiled.
* **Messy Pull-ups:** The inmate must be changed into pull-ups; she will be allowed to ask to go to the bathroom as normal, but she will not be allowed a change until the pull-ups are soiled *and* have leaked urine.
* **Demoted to Diapers:** The inmate must be changed into diapers, and may not wear any clothing that covers them. She may not go to the bathroom, nor be changed, until she is both soiled and wet.

## Serious punishments
Serious punishments are imposed for infractions such as:
* Successfully using the bathroom without permission.
* Attempting to evade a moderate punishment.

Examples of serious punishments:
* Two moderate punishments at once.
* The inmate must wear a restraint until she has performed the moderate punishment she avoided.
* **Full Day Topless:** The inmate must remove all clothing above her waist, and may not cover her breasts for twenty-four hours; and must expose her panties on request. She must allow any authority or student to touch and/or cum on her breasts, and to touch her panties.
* **Streaker:** The inmate must remove all clothing except her panties, and may wear nothing but her panties for the next hour. She must allow any authority or student to touch her with their hands wherever they choose, and must allow them to cum on her on request.
* **Wet All Day:** The inmate may not pee except in her panties for twenty-four hours; she may not ask for a change of panties unless she needs to urinate, and must ask to wet herself immediately after being changed.
* **Jumbo Panty Filler:** THe inmate may not poo except in her panties for twenty-four hours. She may change after a soiling, and may use the bathroom to pee as normal.
* **Poopy Panty Wetter:** The inmate may not pee, except in her panties, until she soils herself, and then must pee in her panties once more. She may not change until after the last wetting.
* **Very Soggy and Squishy:** The inmate may not ask permission to change her panties unless she has soiled and wet herself twice each.
* **Not Ready For Pull-ups:** The inmate must be changed into pull-ups. All restroom monitors will order her to have an accident in front of the toilet. She will not be allowed a change until the pull-ups have been soiled twice and have leaked twice.
* The inmate must be changed into diapers, and may not wear any clothing that covers them. She may not go to the bathroom, nor be changed, until her diaper leaks.

## Severe punishments
Severe punishments are generally imposed for only one of two reasons: the inmate attempted to evade a serious punishment, or the inmate's sentence includes a periodic severe punishment.

Examples of severe punishments:
* **Full Day Streaker:** As with "Streaker", but for twenty-four hours.
* **Full Day Potty-Pants:** The inmate may not pee or poo except in her panties, and may not have her panties changed, for a full twenty-four hours, starting from the first time she wets or soils herself.
* The inmate must wear a urine-activated vibrator for twenty-four hours; she may not urinate except in her panties, may not ask to change her panties, and may not ask permission to cum.

# Sentencing
An inmate will typically be sentenced to additional periodic punishments on top of the normal BCI rules. Some examples:

## Light sentences
These are typically equivalent to a mild punishment every day, a moderate punishment once a week, and a serious punishment once a month.

Example sentences:
* **Weak Bladder.** Daily: Bedwetter; Weekly: Wet Wetter (at the start of homeroom); Monthly: Wet All Day
* **Pooper.** Daily: Panty Pooper (at the start of homeroom); Weekly: Soggy and Squishy (starting when she first soils erself); Monthly:
