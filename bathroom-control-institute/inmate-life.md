<!-- TITLE: Inmate Life -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Inmate Life -->

Life as an inmate at BCI is a series of humiliating toilet accidents, prolonged periods without being allowed to change her dirty panties, and humiliating chores to perform to get those changes.

# Bathroom Control
The most important rule at BCI is that inmates are *not allowed* to urinate or defecate unless specifically authorized by a teacher or staff member, and are *required* to urinate or defecate as directed by a teacher or staff member.

An inmate that needs to go to the bathroom must immediately inform the nearest authority, indicating whether she needs to pee or poop. The authority will then decide whether or not the inmate is allowed to relieve herself, and in what manner she must do so. If the inmate is denied permission to go to the bathroom, she is allowed to continue to beg until told to stop. However, if the inmate is ordered to "have an accident", she must immediately do so without any further comment or face additional punishment.

On the rare occasions when the inmate is given permission to go to the bathroom by a teacher during class, she must also ask the restroom monitor for permission to go as well. The restroom monitor is also allowed to deny permission for the inmate to use that restroom or order her to have an accident.

If an inmate is denied permission to go to the bathroom, she may ask for permission to pee or poop in her panties. This request also may be granted or denied at the authority's discretion. Once an inmate has asked permission to wet or soil herself, she will no longer be allowed to use the toilet in any circumstances; she must either wet or soil herself if given permission, or hold it if she is not.

## Accident On Command
An inmate ordered to "have an accident" must proceed to the location specified by the authority (typically a public place - during class, this is usually in front of the blackboard), adopt the required pose, and proceed to urinate or defecate in her panties or diaper until she is empty.

Importantly, in the social context of BCI, this is treated as if the inmate had actually had an accident. Students will laugh and point, commenting on how shameful it is that the inmate could not make it to the bathroom, how she would've made it if she were a big girl, and so forth. Inmates are *required* to join in this mockery; any inmate that fails to express at least some scorn for another inmate having an accident will generally receive a mild punishment

Once the inmate has done wetting or soiling herself, the authority will generally berate the inmate for her poor toilet training, accuse her of not trying hard enough to make it to the bathroom, and so forth. The authority may also order the inmate to:
* **Tell everyone what you just did**: The inmate must answer along the lines of "I wet myself" or "I pooped my panties."
* **Show everyone what you just did**: The inmate must lower her pants or lift her skirt and present her freshly wet or soiled panties.
* **Answer why you had an accident**: The inmate must answer along the lines of "I couldn't hold it any longer," "I had to go too bad", or otherwise falsely claim that she involuntarily wet or soiled herself. If the inmate truthfully answers that she was told to have an accident, she will be called a liar, interrogated until she "admits the truth", and given additional punishment.

## "Actual" Accidents
At times, an inmate may actually lose control of her bladder or bowels, either because of a dose of Urgencinin or because she was simply denied permission to go until she genuinely could not hold it any longer.

When an inmate feels herself begin to lose control of her bodily functions, she must immediately go to the nearest authority, announce "I'm peeing/pooping my panties", and remain in place until she has finished wetting or soiling herself. If she loses control in class, she must stand up beside her seat and make the announcement. If she has finished going before she reaches an authority, she must make her announcement in the past tense.

When interrogated as to why the inmate had an accident, the inmate must answer along the lines of "I didn't want to wait to go to the bathroom like a big girl", "I decided I'd rather go to the bathroom in my panties", or otherwise falsely assert that she voluntarily wet or soiled herself. As with the reverse case, if the inmate truthfully answers that she couldn't hold it, she will be called a liar, accused of deliberately wetting or soiling herself until she "admits the truth", and given additional punishment.

Regardless of the reason, any inmate who has an "actual" accident will be punished for going in her panties on purpose. Inmates are encouraged to ask for permission to have an accident to avoid this punishment.

## Bedwetting
Thanks to Potidiol PM, it is virtually guaranteed that all inmates will wet the bed every night. When an inmate wets the bed, she will be berated by the dorm manager, being told that she should get up to go to the bathroom when she needs to pee instead of peeing in her pajamas.

If the inmate does not already urgently need to urinate, the dorm manager will administer a dose of Urgencinin-W to ensure that she does. The inmate will then be required to carry her wet sheets to the clothesline in front of the dormitories, hang them on the line, then remove her pajamas and hang those on the line as well, then stand beside her wet sheets and pajamas wearing only her wet underwear for fifteen minutes. 

During her bedwetting punishment, the inmate is required to stand with her hands behind her back and her feet 30cm apart, and is not allowed to hold her hands in front of her in any way, nor allow her knees to touch; each disobedience will add one minute to her sentence. The inmate is encouraged to beg to be allowed to go to the bathroom, but will be told to hold it until her bedwetting punishment is over. She will eventually wet herself, which will be treated as usual for an "actual" accident.

Each dorm manager is in charge of four inmates, which will generally be punished at the same time. The first inmate to wet herself will be denied bathroom and changing privileges until noon.

# Cleanup
An inmate who has wet or soiled her panties is required to continue to wear her soaked or loaded panties until given permission by an authority to change. Except in rare instances, an inmate will not be granted permission to change her own panties, and she will be severely punished if she attempts to do so without permission.

## Asking permission
A wet or soiled inmate must ask an authority for permission to get a change, saying whether she is wet or soiled or both. The authority can agree to change the inmate, refuse to allow her to change, require her to wait, or require the inmate to perform any task in order to get permission to change. It is customary for inmates to be required to sexually gratify someone, either the authority themselves or another authority or student, to get permission. The authority may also allow another authority or a student to change the inmate, or have the other person supply their own requirements to grant the change of panties.

The inmate is allowed to refuse to perform a task required of her, but obviously must then continue to wear her dirty panties, and cannot subsequently ask the same authority for permission to change unless she has gone to the bathroom (either in the toilet or in her panties again) since she first asked.

Whenever the inmate goes to the bathroom in her panties, she must immediately ask the nearest authority for permission to change. It is customary for the authority to deny this request outright (usually with a lecture on why the inmate doesn't deserve clean panties) and forbid the student from asking again.
