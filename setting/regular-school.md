<!-- TITLE: Regular School -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Common bathroom rules at normal schools -->

The following rules are commonly implemented at normal public schools.
# Restroom Passes
A bathroom pass is required to use public school restrooms *at all*, even between classes. Students who lack a restroom pass and cannot hold it until after school must go in their pants.

However, just because a student has a bathroom pass does not automatically mean that the student is allowed to go to the bathroom. Each bathroom pass has a QR code indicating how the student is allowed to relieve herself. Generally, a bathroom pass has three pieces of information associated with it: holding period, toilet permission, and changing permission.

Note that some restroom passes are effectively a punishment, requiring the student to relieve themselves in an embarrassing or uncomfortable manner, such as in front of the class, in their pants, or both.

### Holding Period
The first piece of information indicates how long the student must hold it before allowed to relieve themselves. Typical values are:

* *Immediately:* The student is allowed to relieve themselves whenever they wish.
* *Wait X minutes:* The student must wait for the specified time, then present the (same) bathroom pass again.
* *At end of class:* The student must wait until five minutes before the end of class.
* *After class:* The student must wait for the full class period, then present the bathroom pass to the restroom attendant between classes.
* *Next Class, then X:* The student must wait until the next class; at the start of the next class they may be told to wait an additional amount of time (from the above list).
* *Never:* The worst kind of holding period - the student is not allowed to go to the bathroom, even between classes. They must either hold it until the end of school or have an accident. (If the student does have an accident, the "bathroom pass" is considered used, and they may use a different bathroom pass the next time they go to the bathroom.) This sort of pass is almost always issued as a punishment.

### Toilet Permission
The second piece of information indicates *how* the student is allowed to relieve themselves. Typical values are:

* *Restroom:* The student may use the school restrooms normally like a big girl.
* *Potty:* The student must use a public potty in front of her fellow students. Each classroom has a potty, and additional potties are placed in front of school restrooms.
* *Pants:* The student must go to the bathroom in their pants.
* *Pants (exposed):* Not only must the student go to the bathroom in their pants, but they must stand in front of the class and lift their skirt above their waist or lower their trousers to their thighs.

Note that "pants" toilet permission does *not* count as having an accident for punishment purposes.

### Changing Permission
Sometimes a student may have wet or soiled pants, whether because of an accident or being required to by the bathroom pass. In either case, the changing permission indicates when and how the student may change their dirty underwear. Typical values are:

* *Immediately:* The student may change their underwear immediately upon relieving themselves.
* *Wait X minutes:* The student may not change their underwear until the specified amount of time has passed.
* *At end of class:* The student must wait until five minutes before the end of class.
* *After class:* The student must wait for the full class period, then change themselves between classes.
* *Never:* The student may not change their underwear at all until they next use a bathroom pass.

Additionally, the student's changing permission may be either public or private.

### Choice
Sometimes a bathroom pass may have multiple options, each with a different holding period. For example, a bathroom pass may have the following choices:

* Immediately, Pants (exposed), Never
* At end of class, Pants, Next Class+30min (public)
* Next class+Immediately, Potty, After Class (private)

If the student presents such a bathroom pass, the teacher will tell them they may either go in their pants in front of the class, or wait until the end of class and ask again. If the student chooses to wait, they will be offered the option of going in their pants or waiting until the next class. If the student still chooses to wait, the next teacher will instruct the student to use the potty. The student does not find out how long they will have to wait for a change until after they relieve themselves.

With a choice card, usually (but not always) the shortest holding periods go with the most humiliating toilet permissions and the longest changing permissions.

# Restroom Pass Issuing
At the first day of the semester and the first day after midterms, all students are issued fifteen passes that are "After Class, Restroom, Immediately" and ten passes that are "Next Class, Pants (exposed), Never". Unlike future issues, these passes are clearly marked, with the restroom passes marked as green and the pants passes marked as red, allowing the student to ration their bathroom passes as they see fit.

For each subsequent week, the student will be issued twenty-five passes, according to the following:

* For each time the student used a pass to go in their pants, the student receives one "Bad" pass.
* For each *unused* pass that had a toilet permission of "pants" or "pants (exposed)", the student receives one "Average" pass.
* For each time the student used a pass to use the potty or go to the restroom, the student receives one "Good" pass.
* For each *unused* pass that had a toilet permission of "restroom" or "potty", the student receives one "Very Good" pass.

However, if the student had any accidents in the previous week, each accident replaces one of their passes with a "Very Bad" pass, starting with their best passes first.

## Very Bad passes
These passes are generally issued as a punishment, either for having an accident or for some other misbehavior. None of them allow the student to use the toilet or potty. Roll 3d6:
