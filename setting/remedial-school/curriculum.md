# Remedial School Curriculum
The academic curriculum of a typical remedial school (mathematics, science, religion, history, etc.) is the same as for regular schools. Where remedial schools differ markedly is in the rules regarding students' access to the restroom - or perhaps more accurately, the lack thereof.

## Access to the Bathroom
Unlike regular schools, which sometimes provide hall passes for particularly good students, remedial schools do not permit girls to leave the classroom to go to the bathroom at all. In addition, the child's potties are absent. A remedial-school girl is expected to wait until the end of class to go to the bathroom, and if she cannot or will not, she will have no choice but to go to the bathroom in her panties.

Even if a student makes it until the end of class, though, she still may not be guaranteed an opportunity to use the toilet. Each student is granted a number of "urination passes" and "defecation passes" according to her bathroom performance; if a student needs to urinate during school and lacks a "pee pass", even making it to the end of class does not spare her the humilation of wetting herself.

Just because a student lacks a pee pass, though, does not mean she should just wet herself when she feels the urge. As described under ["Bathroom and Accident Grading"](#bathroom-and-accident-grading), a student who makes it all the way through class only to wet herself right in front of the bathroom will still earn a good grade for bladder control, which she needs to earn the privilege of changing the panties she just peed in.

## Morning Bladder Control Test
The most notable bathroom rule is the morning bladder control test, colloquially known as the "whizz quiz". Each school morning, none of the girls are allowed to go to the bathroom until all of them have wet themselves. The longer each girl holds out, the better their score on the test.

Each class has sixteen girls, and the morning quiz is graded on the curve. Accordingly, the first girl to wet herself earns an F, the next four earn a D, the next six earn a C, the next four earn a B, and the last girl to wet herself earns an A. After the morning quiz is complete, each student is given one bladder bathroom pass for each grade point. Thus, the first girl to wet herself gets *no* pee passes that day, the next four get one pass, etc.

The Monday test is particularly high stakes, as it also determines how many bowel bathroom passes each student gets for the *week*. Thus, whoever is the first to wet herself on Monday morning will not only have to spend the rest of the day wetting herself, but will have to soil herself for the rest of the week as well. (Any girl capable of holding her poo for a whole school day is unlikely to be in remedial school in the first place.) Even the girl with the best bladder control in the class will probably poop her panties at some point in the week, as she only has four poo passes to spread over five days.

Any girl who begins to wet herself less than one minute after another girl begins to wet herself is deemed to have "tied" with the first girl. Thus, if three other girls wet themselves within a minute of the first girl doing so, all four will "tie" for an F. The first period teacher or breakfast monitors will not announce any student's morning test grade if any student is still actively wetting herself.

Any girl who soils herself during the morning test automatically earns an F on the test. If she had already earned a higher grade for wetting herself later, any pee passes (and poo passes, if on Monday) that she had earned will be confiscated.

The morning bladder test begins at 7:30 AM on the dot, when breakfast begins, and ends at 9:00, the beginning of second period. Any girl who manages to hold it for this long will be required to wet herself at that time, but earns an automatic A.

A handy table for the morning quiz grading:

Order of Wetting | Grade | Daily Pee Passes/Weekly Poo Passes
--- | --- | ---
First | F | 0
2-5 | D | 1
6-11 | C | 2
12-15 | B | 3
Last | A | 4

## Bathroom and Accident Grading
After the morning test, girls are under the normal regimen of toilet training for remedial school. How long they are able to postpone having an accident (or, occasionally, avoid it entirely) determines their overall toilet-training grade for the day, which in turn determines their changing privileges.

If a girl feels the urge to relieve herself, she must raise her hand, wait to be called upon, and announce her need to relieve herself and the nature of the relief she needs. The typical form of words is "(Teacher), please, I need to (go pee/go poo/go pee and poo)". The teacher will respond, "I see, (Student), but you'll just have to wait." *If a student has an accident before the teacher acknowledges their need to go, she will earn an F.*

Once the girl's need for the toilet is acknowledged, she must stand beside her desk and assume the "holding position" - if she asked to pee, the "holding position" is standing straight up with her feet 30cm apart, and if she asked to poo (or both), the "holding position" is in a crouch. A student must hold the position for at least five minutes before calling on the teacher again; if her knees touch in either position, or if she touches her skirt with her hands, she is deemed to be "potty-dancing" and an additional five minutes is added. *If a student has an accident once their need to go is acknowledged, but without permission to have an accident, she will earn a D.*

If the girl feels she cannot make it until the end of class, once the five minutes (plus potty-dancing penalties) has passed, she may raise her hand, wait to be called on and announce that she needs to have an accident: "(Teacher), please, I can't hold it any longer - may I please go (pee/poo/pee and poo) in my panties?" The teacher may refuse such a request up to three times. If the teacher grants the request, the student must walk to the front of the classroom, lift her skirt to expose the front (for wetting) or rear (for soiling) of her panties, and wet or soil herself as requested. *If a student has an accident during class after being given permission, she will earn a C.*

At the end of class, if any girls asked to go to the bathroom and have not yet had an accident, the students are led to a restroom, and the students who needed the bathroom line up in *reverse* order from when they asked - that is, the girl who asked latest gets to be in the front of the line, and the girl who asked the earliest is in the back. Girls in the potty line are not only allowed to "potty dance" without further penalty, but are *required* to press their skirt into their crotch (if they asked to pee), against their bottom (if they asked to poo), or both. *If a student has an accident in the potty line, she will earn a B.*

Once a girl reaches the front of the line, she must ask the restroom monitor, "Please, may I go to the bathroom? I need to go (pee/poo) really bad." Once the restroom monitor has taken the girl's pee and/or poo pass and says "Yes, you may,", the girl is deemed to have "made it" for grading purposes, even if she loses control before actually getting to the toilet. If a girl reaches the front of the line without having the relevant pass, she must still ask to go to the bathroom, but the monitor will say, "No, (student), you've been a bad girl, so you have to (pee/poo) in your panties." The student must then lift her skirt and wet and/or soil herself as instructed. Either way, *if a student makes it to the front of the potty line without having an accident, she will earn an A,* even if she ends up having an accident afterward.

Point of Accident | Grade
--- | --- | ---
Without asking to go | F
After asking to go | D
In class, after asking to have an accident | C
In the bathroom line | B
At the front of the bathroom line | A

There are a few additional rules to discourage students from "speculatively" asking to go to the bathroom before they actually feel the urge.
* If a student asks to have an accident, but then fails to present her panties and go to the bathroom in them, she may not ask to go the bathroom again until she does do so in her panties, earning an automatic F. This punishment will be carried over to the next day if necessary.
* If a student has asked to go to the bathroom but shows no sign of desperation, in the "holding position", the teacher may demand that the student come up to the front of the class and have an accident. If she fails to do so, she will earn an automatic F; but if she does go in her panties, not only does she earn an automatic A, but she is immediately given a hall pass and a changing pass and permitted to go to the restroom to clean up. *This is the only circumstance under which girls may leave in the middle of class for toilet-related reasons.*

## Changes of Panties
After a student has an accident, she may change her panties after a certain amount of time passes, depending on what letter grade they earned for that accident. If the student has additional accidents in her panties before she changes, additional time is added depending on the letter grade for that accident.

Grade | Initial Time | Penalty
--- | --- | ---
F | 4 hours | 1 hour
D | 3 hours | 45 minutes
C | 2 hours | 30 minutes
B | 1 hour | 15 minutes
A | N/A | None

Students may ask to change at any time after they become eligible for a change. However, if they ask to change during class, they must do so at a cleanup station in full view of the classroom; if they ask to change during lunch, they must use a cleanup station in full view of the whole cafeteria.

If the student's next time to change is after the end of the school day, the time will be noted on the student's daily [bathroom report card](/setting/remedial-school/bathroom-report-card). Parents are recommended to not allow their daughter to change their panties until this time, plus any penalty time the parents may add according to their own rules.

### Example
Debbie wets herself at 8:13 AM, and is the eighth girl to wet herself. She thus earns a C for the morning test, and will be allowed to change at 10:13 AM.

Before she can get to that point, however, she soils herself at 9:52 AM after asking to do so. This earns a C, adding an additional 30 minutes of penalty time; she will now be allowed to change at 10:43 AM.

At 10:43 AM, Debbie finds herself suddenly on the verge of wetting her panties. She does not bother asking for a change, since she believes she will be wetting herself shortly anyway. Her guess proves correct; eleven minutes later, at 10:54 PM, she asks for and recieves permission to pee her panties, and promptly does so. This earns another C, postponing her next change until 11:13 AM, during lunch.

Since Debbie is too embarrassed to change her panties in front of the whole cafeteria, she waits until the end of lunch break, getting in line at the end of lunch and changing her panties at 11:28 AM.

Unfortunately, the next period, gym class, is the bane of many students' toilet training, and so it proves for Debbie. At 11:36 AM, Debbie wets her panties and gym shorts before she even has time to blurt out that she needs to pee. This earns her an F, and a changing time of 3:36 PM. Debbie is now doomed to go without a change for the rest of the school day.

At 12:53 PM, Debbie asks to poop; at 1:16 her urge is bad enough that she asks to soil her panties. The teacher denies her permission, but Debbie is able to hold out not only until the end of class, but actually makes it to the front of the bathroom line. Unfortunately, since she'd asked to poo her panties, she still has to do it; but nevertheless she earns an A, and her changing time is still 3:36 PM.

She has two more accidents in school - a B wetting accident at 2:28 PM and a D wetting accident at 3:14 PM. These add 15 minutes and 45 minutes, respectively, to her changing time. She leaves school with a bathroom report card recommending that she not be allowed to change her (now very wet and messy) panties until 4:36 PM.

# Dress Code
The dress code at a remedial school is *not* intended to prevent academic distractions to the opposite sex; quite the contrary, it is intended to maximize the humiliation and discomfort of toilet accidents for female students. Accordingly, attire for female students is not intended to provide for modesty.

## Panties
The most important part of the female dress code is underwear. With a few exceptions, female students at remedial school must wear special training panties at all times. Training panties have the following features:

* **Full coverage.** Training panties are styled as full briefs, with the seat completely covering the buttocks and the waistline well above the hips. This is not to provide modesty, but to ensure that the underwear can retain a substantial volume of feces.
* **Thick and absorbent,** but not *too* absorbent. They will retain a small amount of urine, enough to remain wet for long periods after being dampened, but will absorb no more than a tenth of a full bladder before soaking through. Cotton or cotton-like fabrics are common.
* **Wetness-indicating.** Even small amounts of urine quickly wick through the fabric, so that the slightest leaks will be evident to the eye.
* **Childish designs.** They are white with childish patterns; floral or heart patterns are common, as are children's cartoon characters. Many training panties are designed so that their pattern changes color when wet.
* **Drawstrings.** Training panties are designed to allow drawstrings to be inserted along the waistband and legbands; the drawstrings are then locked, with an electronic key provided to restroom monitors. The drawstrings prevent students from removing their panties without faculty permission, thus ensuring that a student with inadequate control of her bodily functions cannot avoid urinating or defecating in her panties, nor remove her dirty panties on her own. They also keep the panties from falling off when heavily loaded with feces.

## Diapers
Under most conditions, parents are strongly discouraged from allowing remedial-school students to wear diapers; the point of remedial school is to train the student to be able to wear normal panties without having excessive amounts of accidents. However, some parents are known to use diapers as a punishment, and school rules allow for this purpose.
