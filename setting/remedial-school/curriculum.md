# Curriculum
The academic curriculum of a typical remedial school (mathematics, science, religion, history, etc.) is the same as for regular schools. Where remedial schools differ markedly is in the rules regarding students' access to the restroom - or perhaps more accurately, the lack thereof.

## Access to the Bathroom
Unlike regular schools, which sometimes provide hall passes for particularly good students, remedial schools do not permit girls to leave the classroom to go to the bathroom at all. In addition, the child's potties are absent. A remedial-school girl is expected to wait until the end of class to go to the bathroom, and if she cannot or will not, she will have no choice but to go to the bathroom in her panties.

Even if a student makes it until the end of class, though, she still may not be guaranteed an opportunity to use the toilet. Each student is granted a number of "urination passes" and "defecation passes" according to her bathroom performance; if a student needs to urinate during school and lacks a "pee pass", even making it to the end of class does not spare her the humilation of wetting herself.

Just because a student lacks a pee pass, though, does not mean she should just wet herself when she feels the urge. As described under "Bathroom and Accident Grading", a student who makes it all the way through class only to wet herself right in front of the bathroom will still earn a good grade for bladder control, which she needs to earn the privilege of changing the panties she just peed in.

## Morning Bladder Control Test
The most notable bathroom rule is the morning bladder control test, colloquially known as the "whizz quiz". Each school morning, none of the girls are allowed to go to the bathroom until all of them have wet themselves. The longer each girl holds out, the better their score on the test.

Each class has sixteen girls, and the morning quiz is graded on the curve. Accordingly, the first girl to wet herself earns an F, the next four earn a D, the next six earn a C, the next four earn a B, and the last girl to wet herself earns an A. After the morning quiz is complete, each student is given one bladder bathroom pass for each grade point. Thus, the first girl to wet herself gets *no* pee passes that day, the next four get one pass, etc.

The Monday test is particularly high stakes, as it also determines how many bowel bathroom passes each student gets for the *week*; thus the first girl to wet herself on Monday is not only denied permission to use the bathroom to pee for the day, but also denied to use the bathroom to poo for the whole week. The only way Monday's first wetter can avoid soiling herself that week is to be able to hold her poo for the *entire* school day - a feat which is basically impossible for any girl with poor enough toilet training to be in remedial school.

A handy table for the whizz quiz grading:

Order of Wetting | Grade | Daily Pee Passes/Weekly Poo Passes
--- | --- | ---
First | F | 0
2-5 | D | 1
6-11 | C | 2
12-15 | B | 3
Last | A | 4
