# Remedial School Curriculum
The academic curriculum of a typical remedial school (mathematics, science, religion, history, etc.) is the same as for regular schools. Where remedial schools differ markedly is in the rules regarding students' access to the restroom - or perhaps more accurately, the lack thereof.

## Access to the Bathroom
Unlike regular schools, which sometimes provide hall passes for particularly good students, remedial schools do not permit girls to leave the classroom to go to the bathroom at all. In addition, the child's potties are absent. A remedial-school girl is expected to wait until the end of class to go to the bathroom, and if she cannot or will not, she will have no choice but to go to the bathroom in her panties.

Even if a student makes it until the end of class, though, she still may not be guaranteed an opportunity to use the toilet. Each student is granted a number of "urination passes" and "defecation passes" according to her bathroom performance; if a student needs to urinate during school and lacks a "pee pass", even making it to the end of class does not spare her the humilation of wetting herself.

Just because a student lacks a pee pass, though, does not mean she should just wet herself when she feels the urge. As described under ["Bathroom and Accident Grading"](#bathroom-and-accident-grading), a student who makes it all the way through class only to wet herself right in front of the bathroom will still earn a good grade for bladder control, which she needs to earn the privilege of changing the panties she just peed in.

## Morning Bladder Control Test
The most notable bathroom rule is the morning bladder control test, colloquially known as the "whizz quiz". Each school morning, none of the girls are allowed to go to the bathroom until all of them have wet themselves. The longer each girl holds out, the better their score on the test.

Each class has sixteen girls, and the morning quiz is graded on the curve. Accordingly, the first girl to wet herself earns an F, the next four earn a D, the next six earn a C, the next four earn a B, and the last girl to wet herself earns an A. After the morning quiz is complete, each student is given one bladder bathroom pass for each grade point. Thus, the first girl to wet herself gets *no* pee passes that day, the next four get one pass, etc.

The Monday test is particularly high stakes, as it also determines how many bowel bathroom passes each student gets for the *week*. Thus, whoever is the first to wet herself on Monday morning will not only have to spend the rest of the day wetting herself, but will have to soil herself for the rest of the week as well. (Any girl capable of holding her poo for a whole school day is unlikely to be in remedial school in the first place.) Even the girl with the best bladder control in the class will probably poop her panties at some point in the week, as she only has four poo passes to spread over five days.

A handy table for the morning quiz grading:

Order of Wetting | Grade | Daily Pee Passes/Weekly Poo Passes
--- | --- | ---
First | F | 0
2-5 | D | 1
6-11 | C | 2
12-15 | B | 3
Last | A | 4

## Bathroom and Accident Grading
After the morning test, girls are under the normal regimen of toilet training for remedial school. How long they are able to postpone having an accident (or, occasionally, avoid it entirely) determines their overall toilet-training grade for the day, which in turn determines their changing privileges.

If a girl feels the urge to relieve herself, she must raise her hand, wait to be called upon, and announce her need to relieve herself and the nature of the relief she needs. The typical form of words is "(Teacher), please, I need to (go pee/go poo/go pee and poo)". The teacher will respond, "I see, (Student), but you'll just have to wait." *If a student has an accident before the teacher acknowledges their need to go, she will earn an F.*

Once the girl's need for the toilet is acknowledged, she must stand beside her desk and assume the "holding position" - if she asked to pee, the "holding position" is standing straight up with her feet 30cm apart, and if she asked to poo (or both), the "holding position" is in a crouch. A student must hold the position for at least five minutes before calling on the teacher again; if her knees touch in either position, or if she touches her skirt with her hands, she is deemed to be "potty-dancing" and an additional five minutes is added. *If a student has an accident once their need to go is acknowledged, but without permission to have an accident, she will earn a D.*

If the girl feels she cannot make it until the end of class, once the five minutes (plus potty-dancing penalties) has passed, she may raise her hand, wait to be called on and announce that she needs to have an accident: "(Teacher), please, I can't hold it any longer - may I please go (pee/poo/pee and poo) in my panties?" The teacher may refuse such a request up to three times. If the teacher grants the request, the student must walk to the front of the classroom, lift her skirt to expose the front (for wetting) or rear (for soiling) of her panties, and wet or soil herself as requested. *If a student has an accident during class after being given permission, she will earn a C.*

At the end of class, if any girls asked to go to the bathroom and have not yet had an accident, the students are led to a restroom, and the students who needed the bathroom line up in *reverse* order from when they asked - that is, the girl who asked latest gets to be in the front of the line, and the girl who asked the earliest is in the back. Girls in the potty line are not only allowed to "potty dance" without further penalty, but are *required* to press their skirt into their crotch (if they asked to pee), against their bottom (if they asked to poo), or both. *If a student has an accident in the potty line, she will earn a B.*

Once a girl reaches the front of the line, she must ask the restroom monitor, "Please, may I go to the bathroom? I need to go (pee/poo) really bad." Once the restroom monitor has taken the girl's pee and/or poo pass and says "Yes, you may,", the girl is deemed to have "made it" for grading purposes, even if she loses control before actually getting to the toilet. If a girl reaches the front of the line without having the relevant pass, she must still ask to go to the bathroom, but the monitor will say, "No, (student), you've been a bad girl, so you have to (pee/poo) in your panties." The student must then lift her skirt and wet and/or soil herself as instructed. Either way, *if a student makes it to the front of the potty line without having an accident, she will earn an A,* even if she ends up having an accident afterward.

Point of Accident | Grade
--- | --- | ---
Without asking to go | F
After asking to go | D
In class, after asking to have an accident | C
In the bathroom line | B
At the front of the bathroom line | A

There are a few additional rules to discourage students from "speculatively" asking to go to the bathroom before they actually feel the urge.
* If a student asks to have an accident, but then fails to present her panties and go to the bathroom in them, she may not ask to go the bathroom again until she does do so in her panties, earning an automatic F. This punishment will be carried over to the next day if necessary.
* If a student has asked to go to the bathroom but shows no sign of desperation, in the "holding position", the teacher may demand that the student come up to the front of the class and have an accident. If she fails to do so, she will earn an automatic F; but if she does go in her panties, not only does she earn an automatic A, but she is immediately given a hall pass and a changing pass and permitted to go to the restroom to clean up. *This is the only circumstance under which girls may leave in the middle of class for toilet-related reasons.*
