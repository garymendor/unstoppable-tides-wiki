# Home Assignments
Parents of a girl in remedial school shouldn't expect the school to do all the work of potty-training their daughter. Most remedial schools offer guidance to parents on how to help supplement the school's potty-training efforts.

The following advice is provided to parents upon enrolling their daughter in remedial school.

## Morning
Although your daughter will get a full breakfast at school, you are encouraged to help her remain hydrated; a simple glass of juice or water on awakening should suffice.

Your daughter should not be allowed to use the toilet until she has finished dressing for school. If she has an accident before then, you should not allow her to change her panties before she leaves; she will have the opportunity to change when she arrives at school.

### Bedwetting
If your daughter wet the bed in the night, she should be required to carry her wet sheets to a clothesline and hang them up, along with her pajamas or nightshirt. Whether the clothesline is in the back yard or front yard is up to you; for many girls, the prospect of having to publicly display her wet bedsheets, followed by stripping to her wet panties, helps encourage serious effort to avoid wetting the bed.

You should not allow your daughter to change her wet panties before leaving for school, the same as if she had had an accident after awakening. Additionally, if your daughter asks to go to the bathroom after wetting the bed, you should require her to go to the bathroom in her panties as a punishment.

## After school
You should not allow your daughter to change her panties or go to the bathroom until she has finished her homework. Holding it until her homework is done - or if she cannot hold it, having to finish her homework while sitting in wet or soiled panties - is her primary potty-training homework. If any of your daughter's teachers have assigned multi-day projects such as essays or presentations, the teacher will send home a note indicating the minimum amount of time your daughter must spend on the project each day.

Your daughter will be sent home with two copies of a [bathroom report card](/setting/remedial-school/bathroom-report-card) each day; sign one and send it to school with her the next day. If your daughter comes home in wet or soiled panties because she was not allowed to change before going home, the report card will indicate a time of day at which your daughter should be allowed to change.

You should not allow your daughter to wear diapers or pull-ups at home. If she has an accident, she should be required to clean the floor and any other messes she makes, and generally should not be allowed to change her panties for some time after her accident.

## Bedtime
If possible, avoid allowing your daughter to wear Goodnites or other nighttime protection to bed; your daughter should be old enough not to have nighttime accidents, and having to go to bed without protection will encourage your daughter to go to the bathroom in the night instead of relying on diapers to absorb her accident.

If your daughter has a severe problem with bedwetting or bedsoiling and allowing her to sleep without protection is impractical, you should at least require her to wear panties under her nighttime diapers. Additionally, you should prefer pull-up style nighttime protection over full diapers, so that she will have the opportunity to use the bathroom.
