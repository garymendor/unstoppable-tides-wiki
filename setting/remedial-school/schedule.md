# Arrive at School
Buses arrive at the school between 7:00 and 7:30 AM. The girls' bathrooms are open until 7:30, to ensure that everyone can start the [morning bladder control test](./curriculum#morning-bladder-control-test) with an empty bladder and clean panties.

When a girl gets in the morning bathroom line, her panties will be inspected. If she is wet or soiled, she must present her panties while she waits in line. Once she is in line, if she believes she cannot make it to the bathroom before breakfast, she may ask to wet or soil herself. She must present her panties while having the accident, and continue to do so until she reaches the front of the line.

At ten seconds before 7:30 AM, the school bell will chime for ten seconds. When the school bell finishes ringing, the morning bladder test begins. Any girls who are still in the bathroom, or who are currently wetting or soiling themselves in line, will automatically get an F.

# Breakfast
Breakfast is provided for all students. Typical breakfasts include tea, water or orange juice, whole wheat toast or bran muffins, and a choice of eggs, bacon, or sausage. Girls are required to drink at least two cups of tea and a full serving of the grain portion of their breakfast, and may eat and drink as much as they like beyond that point, as time allows.

The morning bladder test is ongoing during breakfast. Girls who are eating are expected to sit on their skirts for the duration of breakfast; they are allowed to hold themselves, cross their legs, or "potty dance" in whatever way they deem necessary.

Girls may not ask to go to the bathroom or change their panties during breakfast.

# First Period
The morning bladder test continues during first period and ends at the start of second period. As with breakfast, girls must sit on their skirts while seated, but may "potty dance" as much as they need to.

# Classes
During the regular class periods, the standard [rules for going to the bathroom or having accidents](/setting/remedial-school/curriculum#bathroom-and-accident-grading) are in effect. Five minutes' passing time is allowed between classes.

Each classroom has a cleanup station in the front corner of the room opposite the door. The cleanup station is a tiled space with a shower hose, and a large roll of paper towels. Students who wish to change their panties, have clean panties to spare, [have waited long enough to be permitted to change,](/setting/remedial-school/curriculum#changes-of-panties) and do not want to wait until the end of class may use this space to clean up.

A student using the cleanup station must clean up in the following order:
* Set clean panties on the counter next to the cleanup station.
* Remove skirt, shoes, socks, and dirty panties, in that order..  
* Place dirty panties in a plastic bag. She may not rinse or clean the panties in any way.  
* Rinse bottom, crotch, and lower body as desired.  
* Put on clean panties, socks, shoes, and skirt in that order. Socks and skirt may not be changed.  

The student is not allowed to urinate or defecate while in the changing area. If the student is unable to control her bladder or bowels after removing her dirty panties, she must immediately pull on her clean panties and urinate or defecate until she is finished. This is considered an accident without asking to go to the bathroom, for which she earns an F and is prohibited from changing the freshly wet or soiled panties for four hours.

# Lunch
Students may use cleanup stations situated in the cafeteria. The rules for using the lunchroom changing stations are the same as for the classroom stations.

Students may not go to the bathroom during lunch; the classroom rules apply to asking to go to the bathroom or to have an accident. Students may go to the bathroom as usual in the five minutes between lunch and gym class.

# Physical Education
Half of the student body takes gym class in the period before lunch; half of it takes gym class after lunch. Students are escorted from their previous class directly to the gym class locker room; if they wish to go to the bathroom, they must line up at the locker room's restroom area, and may not use the restroom after the class bell rings.

The gym class uniform is a white T-shirt and light blue buruma-style gym shorts. Each student is issued one uniform per week, which is stored in their locker between classes. Students have up to two minutes after gym class begins to finish changing into their uniforms.

Students may not change their panties or gym shorts during gym class, even if their allowed changing time falls within that time period. They must wait until the end of gym class, and may get in line to change in the locker room restrooms.

Five minutes before the end of gym class, the gym teacher blows a whistle to call students in. Any girl who urinated or defecated during gym class must remove her gym shorts and shirt *outside* the locker room, hang them on the clothesline outside the girls' locker room, and enter the locker room in her panties, socks, and shoes. All gym uniforms have the student's name printed on them, and their uniforms will be returned to their lockers at the end of the day (or returned to the student on Friday).

During shower time, students whose panties are wet or soiled and whose changing time has not yet arrived may remove their wet or soiled panties to shower, but must put them back on after drying off, and may not rinse or wash them in any way. Each shower stall has an alcove to store panties while showering; any student who loses control of her bladder or bowels while showering must immediately turn off the shower and put her panties back on, and may not do any further cleanup except to dry off her upper body or hair. This is considered an accident without asking to go, and earns an F and the usual changing-time penalty.
# After-School Activities
The last hour of the school day is allocated for school clubs and activities. Students who do not wish to join a club may use the school library for quiet reading time, but may not work on homework. (The reason why students can't work on homework in school is because the student's potty-training "homework" is to wait until her academic homework is done before she can go to the bathroom.)

Students in after-school clubs or study hall follow the same bathroom rules as regular classes, and accidents during this period are graded similarly.
# End of School
At 3:25, the last bell rings. Each student is called by name, given her [bathroom report card](/setting/remedial-school/bathroom-report-card) and her gym uniform (on Friday), and sent to the buses or the car pickup area. Girls may get in line to go to the bathroom on their way to their pickup point; but the buses' doors close promptly at 3:30 PM and the school bathrooms are locked at that time.

# Detention
Students who have been punished with detention will be escorted to the classroom designated as a detention hall. This classroom will have a large panel window open to the adjacent hallway. Other students are allowed to wait outside the detention hall and observe the students in detention.

All girls will be required to drink two cups of tea and take a mild laxative on entering the detention hall. No talking, doing homework, reading recreational books, use of personal electronics, going to the bathroom, or changing of panties is allowed.

Any student who needs to urinate or defecate during detention must stand and present her panties to the window, go to the bathroom in her panties, and remain standing until the detention monitor acknowledges her accident. She will then return to her seat. Accidents during detention are not graded; the student's bathroom report card will be based solely on her performance before detention.
