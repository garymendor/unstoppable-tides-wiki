<!-- TITLE: Setting -->

# The Setting of Unstoppable Tides
The setting resembles a version of modern-day Earth, with many subtle and not-so-subtle differences. The least subtle difference is a high prevalence of female incontinence.

## The Curse of Hosiah
In early childhood, toilet training progresses normally for both boys and girls; throughout elementary school, neither male nor female children have more than the usual difficulty in using the restroom in a socially appropriate manner.

The difference manifests in young girls between the ages of nine and thirteen. Affected girls find that their ability to control either their bladder or bowels (or both) becomes unpredictable. In most girls, their control is normal much of the time, but they will experience "episodes", in which they find themselves with a sudden, urgent need to urinate or defecate. Depending on the severity of the episode, the sufferer may have as much as a half hour or as little as a minute (in severe cases, only a few *seconds*) to find a restroom before she loses control and involuntarily relieves herself.

This would be embarrassing enough, but to make it worse, society stigmatizes these accidents rather than considering them "normal". The predominant religion of Tavism holds that the cause of incontinence is "the curse of Hosiah," the goddess of sin and punishment, and that it episodes are caused by some form of sinful behavior or thought on the part of the victim - especially sins that are not known about by anyone else. Accordingly, girls are still expected to have the same level of toilet training as boys, *no* allowance is made for a girl who suddenly needs to go to the bathroom very badly, and any girl who is unable to make it to the bathroom in time is considered to blame for her own accident.

## Remedial School
Girls who have particularly severe and frequent "episodes" - those who wet themselves more than once a day or soil themselves three or four times a week - will often be placed in special remedial schools, intended to force them into more frequent and challenging efforts to control their bladders and bowels and impose more severe consequences for failure, in the hope that the constant humiliation and discomfort of constantly going to the bathroom in their panties will encourage penitence and repentance.
