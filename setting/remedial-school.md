# Remedial School
Remedial schools are for the most severe wetters and soilers, the most incorrigibly cursed. Rumors fly about the severity of the potty-training curriculum at these schools, and the most common rumor - that girls at remedial are *required* to wet their pants every day - is not only the absolute truth, but only the beginning.

## Curriculum
The academic curriculum of a typical remedial school (mathematics, science, religion, history, etc.) is the same as for regular schools. Where remedial schools differ markedly is in the rules regarding students' access to the restroom - or perhaps more accurately, the lack thereof.

The details of the potty-training curriculum are [described in detail here](/setting/remedial-school/curriculum), but the motivating principles are:
* To use the toilet rather than her panties, the student must postpone the one required panty-wetting as long as possible.
* To earn good potty-training grades, the student must come as close as possible to avoiding an accident the rest of the day.
* To earn more and earlier changes of panties, the student must get good potty-training grades.
