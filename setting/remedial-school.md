# Remedial School
Remedial schools are for the most severe wetters and soilers, the most incorrigibly cursed. Rumors fly about the severity of the potty-training curriculum at these schools, and the most common rumor - that girls at remedial are *required* to wet their pants every day - is not only the absolute truth, but only the beginning.

## Curriculum
The academic curriculum of a typical remedial school (mathematics, science, religion, history, etc.) is the same as for regular schools. Where remedial schools differ markedly is in the [rules regarding students' access to the restroom](/setting/remedial-school/curriculum) - or perhaps more accurately, the lack thereof.
